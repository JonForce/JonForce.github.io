  <h1>Homework 2</h1>

  <p>Please complete this homework before next class. I will be posting the<br/>
    solutions after next class.</p>
  <br>

  <p><b>Problem set A</b></p>
  <p>1. Write a while loop that prints all of the numbers between 0 and 100.</p>

  <p>2. Modify the while loop so that it only prints even numbers.</p>

  <p>3. Create a String variable called name that equals your name.</p>

  <p>4. Create an int called x that starts at 100.
    <br>while x is greater than 0, print x and then decrease its value by 1.</p>

  <p><b>Problem set B</b></p>

  <p>1. Create a function called printHi() that prints out "hi" when called.</p>

  <p>2. Create a function that takes in a integer parameter x. The function
    <br>should be called printNumbersUpTo and it should print all the numbers
    <br>between 0 and x</p>

  <p>3. Create a function that sets the background color to blue. It should be called
    <br>setBackgroundBlue.</p>

  <p><b>Problem set C</b></p>

  <p>1.) First, create the setup and draw functions.</p>

  <p>2.) Next, create four global integers (global means that they're created at the top of the file).
    <br>They should be called x, y, speedX, and speedY.
    <br>x should start off at 200.
    <br>y should start off at 200.
    <br> speedX should start off at 5
    <br>speedY should start at 5
  </p>

  <p>3.) In the draw function, set the background to blue.</p>

  <p>4.) After the background() call in the draw function, draw
    <br>an ellipse at x, y with a width of 20 and height of 20.</p>

  <p>5.) After you draw the ellipse, you should increase x by speedX
    <br>increase y by speedY.
    <br>Also :
    <br>increase speedY by 1.

  <p>6.) The circle should now slide off the screen down and to the right.
      <br>Add an if statement so that if y is greater than height, set speedY
      <br>to be -20.</p>

  <p>7.) Add another if statement so that if the circle's x is greater than
    <br>the width of the window, speedX = -5</p>

  <p>8.) Add a simmilar if statement so that the circle bounces off the left side
      <br>of the screen.</p>

  <p>9.) You should now have a bouncing ball : )</p>

  <p>If the ball is bouncing weirdly, you may have to modify some of the values.</p>
