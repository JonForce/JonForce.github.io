  <h1>Homework 3, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>Have these done by next class. Email me your working code.</b></p>

  <p><b>Prime Number Problem</b></p>

  <p>Your first homework problem is going to be writing a function
    <br>that takes in an integer i, and returns true if the integer is
    <br>a prime number.</p>
  <p>A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.</p>
  <p>Please use the internet as a resource to solve this problem!
    <br>You can even copy code if you'd like. But the only rule is that your
    <br>solution must be in Processing. Submitting code that does not work
    <br>in Processing will not recieve any credit.</p>
  <p>There are lots of ways to solve this problem. Use solutions implemented
    <br>in other languages online for inspiration!</p>
  <p>One way to implement the solution is :
    <br>if you want to find out if the integer n is prime,
    <br>divide n by every number between n-1 and 2.
    <br>If any of those divisions result in a number that does not have
    <br>a decimal, n is not prime.</p>
  <p>The function must return a boolean. It must take in exactly 1 int as a parameter</p>



  <p><b>Space Background</b></p>

  <p>The next problem can be programmed however you want.
    <br>However, I will give you tips on how to accomplish it.</p>

  <p>The goal is to create a white background with back dots on the screen.
    <br>The black dots should move right accross the screen at random speeds,
      <br>so that each dot has a random speed that it moves at accross the screen</p>
  <p>The desired effect is that the dots will create a parrallax effect by
    <br>moving at different speeds. It will make the screen look deep.</p>
  <p>You can draw the dots on the screen using ellipse(...). Make their radiuses 5 by 5.</p>
  <p>You're welcome to implement this however you'd like, but here are some ideas :<br>
    You should probably create a class, Dot that can be used to represent each dot on the screen.
    <br>Dot should probably have variables x, y, and speed.
    <br>You should create many dots, and then draw them in the draw function.
    <br>Move them accross the screen by adding their speed to their x.
    <br>Don't forget to initialize their x, y, and speed variables!
    <br>When a dot gets off the right side of the screen, you'll have to move
      it off the left side of the screen.
