  <h1>Homework 5, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>Have these done by next class.</b></p>

  <p>Web development is a field that develops rapidly, and you will be expected
    <br>to teach yourself a lot. Learning how to research things you don't understand
    <br>is critical because it's impossible to know everything about web development.
    <br>The best developers are good at googling things and know how to learn on their own.</p>

  <p>For the basics of HTML that we went over in class, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE">you can use this video as a
    reference.</a></p>

  <p>If you don't like the video, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3
     schools offers a decent tutorial on HTML as well as CSS and JS.</a></p>

  <p><b>Web Project</b></p>

  <p>1.) Your first task is to create a blank website. Start by creating
    <br>a folder with the following files :
    <br>index.html
    <br>style.css
    <br>script.js
  </p>

  <p>2.) Fill in the html file with necessary code so that you have a
    <br>page with a header, three paragraphs, and button. The button should say "push me".
  </p>

  <p>3.) Link the css file and javascript file to the html file.</p>

  <p>4.) Modify the css file so that each paragraph is a different color.</p>

  <p>5.) Create a JSON object in the javascript file with the following attributes :
    <br>x should equal 106
    <br>name should equal "Test"
    <br>z should equal a function that always returns 100
  </p>

  <p>6.) Use document.write or console.log to test to make sure the JSON object works.
    <br>Print out all the properties of the object and make sure the function z works.</p>

  <p>7.) Create a function called createObject that takes in two parameters, x and y.
    <br> The function should return a JSON object with the the following properties :
    <br> 'a' should equal x times 15.
    <br> 'b' should equal the sum of all numbers between 0 and y
  </p>
