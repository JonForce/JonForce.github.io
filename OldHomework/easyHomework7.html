  <h1>Homework 5</h1>

  <br>

  <p><b>Review</b></p>

  <p>Write a program that creates a window, and colors the left half
    <br>of the window red, and the right half green.</p>

  <p>Write a function called "add" that takes in two integers, x and y.
    <br>It should add them together and return the result. Test your function.</p>

  <p>Create an array of integers containing 1, 4, 6, 1, 10, and 5.
    <br>Next, write a loop that goes over the array and adds all the numbers together.
    <br>It should print the sum of all the numbers.
    <br>[HINT! You'll need a variable to add all the numbers to]
  </p>

  <p><b>Classes</b></p>

  <p>Create a class called Color that has three integers, r, g, and b.</p>

  <p>Create your setup and draw functions. Set the window size to whatever you want.</p>

  <p>Create three global Color objects. Call them x, y, and z.</p>

  <p>In the setup function, set the "r", "g", and "b" properties of x, y, and z
    <br>to be random. Use = (int) random(255); for this</p>

  <p>In the draw function, create a random integer. Use (int) random(3) for this.
    <br>If the random number is 0, draw the background using the r, g, and b from the x object.
    <br>If the random number is 1, draw the background using the r, g, and b from the y object.
    <br>If the random number is 2, draw the background using the r, g, and b from the z object.
  </p>

  <p>Congratulations, your screen should now flash randomly, choosing one of three random colors.</p>
