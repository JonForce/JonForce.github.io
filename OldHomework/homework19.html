  <h1>Homework, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>Welcome back! To refresh your web server development skills,
  you should create this simple web application.</b></p>

  <p>If you need a reference, use the web reference that's linked on the homepage
    <br>of this site.</p>

  <p>1. Create a new web project or erase the code from your current project</p>

  <p>2. Set up the server so that it has two pages,
    <br>/home and /secretpage. The secretpage should just send out 123</p>

  <p>3. Next make /home send out a page with one input, for a password
    (as well as sumbit button).</p>

  <p>4. Now, make it so that when the correct password is submitted, it
   <br> redirects the user to the /secretpage</p>

   <p>Finally, if you got this far, there is one more step you could take
     to secure your site.</p>
    <p>The final step would be to give a cookie to the user that will
      allow them to see /secretpage. Right now they could just type in
      <br>/secretpage and bypass the login. Fix that!</p>

    <p>Copy and paste your code into an email.</p>
