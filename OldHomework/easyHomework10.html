  <h1>Homework 8?</h1>

  <p>This is a comprehensive review. The solutions to these problems are
    <br>available, check your answers against the solutions.</p>

  <p><b>Review Problems</b></p>

  <p>1.) Create an ArrayList of Strings. Add the Strings "A", "B", and "C"
    <br>to the list.
    <br>Print out the third element of the list.
    <br>Extra Credit : Write a loop to print out each element of the list.
  </p>

  <p>2.) Create a class called Apple. Apple should have an int in it
    <br>called counter that starts at 0.
    <br>Next, create a method in apple called printCounter that is void.
    <br>The method should print the value of the Apple's counter when called.
    <br>Create an apple and test the method.
  </p>

  <p><b>Difficult Problems</b></p>

  <p>1.) Create a function called createArray that creates
      <br>an array of floats full of random numbers and returns it.
      <br>The size of the array should be an int parameter to the function.
    </p>

  <p>2.) Create a class called Circle with floats x and y. It should
    <br>also have ints r, g, and b.
    <br>Next create your setup and draw functions.
    <br>Create  a global Circle and set its position and r, g, b values
    <br>to be random.
    <br>Draw the Circle in the draw function. Dont forget to set the fill
    <br>to be the Circle's r g and b values.
    <br>For extra credit, allow the user to move the Circle using
    <br>w a s and d.
  </p>

  <p>3.) Create an array of 5 floats. Write a function that takes
    <br>the array in as a parameter and returns the sum.
    <br>Don't forget to test your code in the setup!</p>
