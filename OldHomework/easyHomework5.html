  <h1>Homework 4</h1>

  <br>

  <p><b>Problem Set A</b></p>

  <p>Create a function called checkAge. The function should take in an
    <br>integer called 'age'. It should return true only if age is greater than 21.</p>

  <p>Write a program that multiplies all of the numbers between 1 and 10 together.
    <p>It should use a for loop to do this. It should print the result.</p>

  <p>Create a function called output. It should take in an integer i. It should print
    <br>out the integer i using println. It does not return anything.
    <br>Next, use a for loop in the setup function to call that function with all
    <br>of the integers between -5 and 10.</p>

  <p><b>Problem Set B</b></p>

  <p>First create the setup and draw functions.</p>

  <p>Next, create the following global variables :
    <br>an integer x (starts at 300)
    <br>an integer y (starts at 300)
    <br>an integer speedX (starts at 1)
    <br>an integer speedY (starts at 1)
  </p>

  <p>Next, in your setup function set the screen size to 800, 600</p>

  <p>In the draw function, add a function call to draw the background.</p>

  <p>After the background(...)  call, draw an ellipse at x, y.</p>

  <p>After you draw the ellipse, make x increase by speedX and y
    <br>increase by speedY every time draw runs.</p>

  <p>Now, add in code into the draw function so that if the circle hits
    <br>the bottom of the screen, the speedY becomes negative. </p>

  <p>Add in more logic so that if the ellipse hits any edge it bounces the other way.</p>

  <p>[Extra Credit] If you're feeling like a challenge, change the program
    <br>to use arrays instead of just integers and fill the screen
    <br>with moving balls. If you are able to do this, I'll show your code off to the class.</p>
