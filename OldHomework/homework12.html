  <h1>Homework 4, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>Have these done by next class.</b></p>

  <p>Web development is a field that develops rapidly, and you will be expected
    <br>to teach yourself a lot. Learning how to research things you don't understand
    <br>is critical because it's impossible to know everything about web development.
    <br>The best developers are good at googling things and know how to learn on their own.</p>

  <p>For the basics of HTML that we went over in class, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE">you can use this video as a
    reference.</a></p>

  <p>If you don't like the video, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3
     schools offers a decent tutorial on HTML.</a></p>

  <p>The first HW problem is to view the HTML code of this website! The answer to problem 1
    <br>is stored in the HTML file in a comment. Your web browser won't render it, but
    <br>if you view the HTML source of this webpage and look through the code, you will see it.</p>
  <!-- Congrats! The answer to problem 1 is M00S3RUL3Z -->

  <p>The next problem is that you should create a web page. It can just be a simple
    <br>HTML file. You can put whatever you want on the page, but it should have your name
    <br>at the top.</p>

  <p>The next problem is that you should look up how to add an image to your web page.
      <br>You should <b>link</b> the image into your website, not download the image.
    <br>The image that you should use is located herer : https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/PETCO/ball-python-1</p>

  <p>Github is a place where you can store your code. You can also use github to
    <br>host your html page. Your final task is to register an account at github.com
    <br>and then follow this tutorial to host your website there. https://pages.github.com/</p>

  <p>Please email me a link to your web page hosted on github : )</p>
