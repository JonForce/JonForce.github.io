  <h1>Homework, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>This assignment will test your ability to use AJAX to communicate
    with the server from the client.</b></p>

  <p>1. In the server, when the client requests the main page,
        <br>return a button called "increase" as well as a number
        <br>above that should start at 0.</p>

  <p>2. Next, make it so that when a user presses that button, the
      <br>number increases. This should be pretty easy.</p>

  <p>3. Finally, add a script into the client that sends the
    <br>server a request to check what the number is on the server and set
    <br>the number on the screen to be that. This way, the user wont
    <br>have to refresh the page to see how many people have pressed the button.</p>
  <p>Part 3 will require that you modify the code that is sent to the client. You
    <br>really need to add in a timer that every 100 milliseconds (or whatever time increment),
    <br>requests an update from the server. Then you need to have a post location
    <br>that returns the new number of times the buttons have been pressed.</p>

  <p> Example of AJAX request in javascript  <pre class="prettyprint">
    $.ajax({
url: "/post",
type: "POST",
data: {clicked:click},
success: function(data){
console.log(data);
shrooms = JSON.parse(data).list;
}
});
</pre>
</p>

<p>Dont forget to include the AJAX script!
  &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</p>

  <p>
    <p>Copy and paste your code into an email.</p>
