  <h1>Homework, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>This homework will test your ability to make a basic web app</b></p>

  <p>If you need a reference, use the web reference that's linked on the homepage
    <br>of this site.</p>

  <p>1. Create a new web project or erase the code from your current project</p>

  <p>2. Set up the web server so that it sends out an html page with a
    <br>form with two inputs, which are text boxes. The inputs should be places
    <br>where the user can enter numbers.
    <br>The form should also have a submit button.
  </p>

  <p>3. Add in code to the website so that when the user submits the form,
    <br>the webserver gets the numbers from the two text boxes, and adds them
    <br>together. Then, return the user a web page with the result of adding
    <br>the two numbers together.</p>

  <p>4. For submission, copy the code from your Driver file and send me that</p>
