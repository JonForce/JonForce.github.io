  <h1>Homework, Year 2</h1>

  <p>Do this homework in preparation of the upcoming lesson. Have a nice easter</p>

  <p>
    Complete the assignment that we detailed in class :
    <br>    What I want you to do for practice is to write a piece of software that we will pretend would be used for managing products in a store. First create a class Store.
    <br> Methods that users will call on the store include :
    <br> - remove(Item i), add(Item i)
    <br> - restock(Item i), destock(Item i)
    <br> - getCandy(int i), getClothing(int i), getElectronic(int i)
    <br> There are three types of items, Candy, Clothing, and Electronic. All three of these types of items should either extend an abstract class Item OR implement an interface Item. You choose, and youâ€™ll have to explain why you chose the way you did.

    <br>In addition, be sure to use proper programming practices including
    <br>keeping your data as private as possible and documenting your code.
