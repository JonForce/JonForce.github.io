  <h1>Homework, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>These are some problems to keep your Java programming fresh.</b></p>

  <p>1. Write a java method that can check if a number is prime or not.
      <br>Be sure to test your method in main!</p>

  <p>2. Write a program that takes in an input looking like this :
        <br>"{a:1, b:1513, c:1003, f:151}"
        <br>And can conver that JSON to a HashMap of String keys
        <br>and int values.
  <br>This one will not be easy. You can write this program however you
    <br>want, but please test your code with multiple inputs.</p>
