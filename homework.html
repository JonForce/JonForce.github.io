  <h1>Ben Homework 1</h1>

  <p>Please complete this homework before next class.</p>
  <br>

  <p><b>Variables Practice</b></p>
  <p>1. Create a float variable that equals 15.5. Call it whatever you like<br>
      Increase the value of that variable by 2 and then print the result.</p>

  <p>2. Create an integer variable, x, that equals 10. Decrease the<br>
      value of the variable by 20, and print the result.</p>

  <p>3. Create a String variable called name, and set it equal to your name.<br>
          Print, "Hello Mr." the variable name (The result should be Hello Mr. Ben)</p>

  <p>4. Create two integer variables x, and y. Set them equal to 10 and 15 respectively.<br>
          Print x times y</p>

  <p><b>Game Programming Practice</b></p>

  <p>1. First, open a new processing window. Create the setup and<br>
        draw functions. Try to do this from memory, if you can't,<br>
        look at another example and copy the code by hand.</p>

  <p>2. Set the window size to be 800 by 600 (in the setup function).</p>

  <p>3. In the draw function, draw a circle at x=100, y=100, with a size<br>
        100 by 100.</p>

  <p>3. Add code so that a rectangle at the position 50, 50 with a<br>
        width of 100 and height of 10 is drawn.</p>

  <p>4. Use the text() function to draw the text, "Poop!" at<br>
        the center of the screen</p>

  <p><b>Game Improvements</b> : these are hard, do your best</p>

  <p>1.) Try to modify your game's code so that the size of the player<br>
          decreases slowly over time. That way if they dont eat they disappear</p>

  <p>2.) Try to modify your game so that when your score is greater than 10000<br>
          the screen shows, "You win!" in the center.</p>
