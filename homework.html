  <h1>Homework 5, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>Have these done by next class.</b></p>

  <p>Web development is a field that develops rapidly, and you will be expected
    <br>to teach yourself a lot. Learning how to research things you don't understand
    <br>is critical because it's impossible to know everything about web development.
    <br>The best developers are good at googling things and know how to learn on their own.</p>

  <p>For the basics of HTML that we went over in class, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE">you can use this video as a
    reference.</a></p>

  <p>If you don't like the video, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3
     schools offers a decent tutorial on HTML as well as CSS and JS.</a></p>

  <p><b>Web Project</b></p>

  <p>1.) Your first task is to create a blank website. Start by creating
    <br>a folder with the following files :
    <br>index.html
    <br>style.css
    <br>script.js
  </p>

  <p>2.) Fill in the html file with necessary code so that you have a
    <br>page with a header, paragraph, and button. The button should say "push me".
  </p>

  <p>3.) Link the css file and javascript file to the html file.</p>

  <p>4.) Modify the css file so that the paragraph is center aligned.</p>

  <p>5.) Modify the html file and js file such that when you press the button,
      <br>an alert pops up saying, "Hello!"</p>

  <p>6.) Add anything else you want! Explore the features of css, javascript, and html.</p>
