  <p><b> Small Game </b></p>

  <p>The next part of your homework is that you have to create a game.
    <br>Don't forget to use the processing reference if you forget how
    <br>to do things in processing, or email me or Andrew.
  </p>
  <p>Your job is to first come up with an idea for a game that you think
    <br>would be easy to make. It should have some basic game elements,
    <br>like a score, or you should be able to win or lose.</p>
  <p>Use classes when making your game!</p>
  <p>If you don't have any easy ideas for making one, then here are some
    <br>easy ideas for game :
    <br>Create a game where you have to avoid circles with your mouse that move
        around randomly.
    <br>Create a game where you have to click when the screen is green, but the
        screen randomly turns red. If you click a red screen you lose.
