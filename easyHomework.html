    <br>(HINT WE DID THIS IN CLASS)</p>

  <p><b>Improving Small Game </b></p>

  <p>For the next part of your homework, I would like you to improve the game
    <br>that you developed last week. Follow these instructions :
    <br>First, improve your code readability. I will be doing code reviews of
    random games<br>on the projector, so don't forget to do this!.
    <br>What I want you to do is to make sure that you're using classes and methods
    <br>so that your code is as readable as possible. Make sure that any code that
    <br>is complicated or hard to read is commented so that you can read the comments
    <br>and understand what the code is doing.
    <br>Take code that is grouped together and put it into a method or function.
    <br>Make sure there are no spots in your program that you have duplicate code.

    <br><br>
    For part II, add a new feature onto your game. Please make sure to email the
    <br>complete game to Andrew and detail exactly what the new feature is.
