  <p><b>Recursion Practice</b></p>

  <p>1. Write a recursive function called printEven() that
    <br> takes in an int i. It should print all the even numbers
    <br> from i down to 0.</p>

  <p>2. Write a recursive function called printAs() that takes
    <br>in an int x. It should print that number of 'A's.</p>

  <p>3. Write a recursive function called evenness. This function
    <br>should take in an integer n and return the number of times
    <br>you can divide the number n divided by 2.
    <br> EX : evenness(8) should return 3 because 8 can be divided by 2 three times.
