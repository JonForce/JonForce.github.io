  <p><b>General Review Problems</b></p>

  <p>1. Create an ArrayList that can store integers.</p>
  <p>2. Fill the ArrayList with 100 random numbers.</p>
  <p>3. Print out all the numbers in the list.</p>
  <p>4. [Hard] Write a program that prints "Hello there!" every 1 second.</p>
  <p>5. Write a for loop that prints all the numbers between 10 and 100?</p>
  <p>7. Write a program that adds together all the numbers between 0 and 100. Print the result.</p>
  <p>9. How do we get the size of an array?</p>
  <p>10. How do we get the size of an ArrayList?</p>

  <p><b>Inheritance Problems</b></p>

  <p>Create a class called Rectangle. Rectangle should have x, y, w (for width), and h (for height).
    <br>Create a constructor that takes in four floats and sets x, y, w, and h to those floats.
    <br>Create another constructor that takes in no parameters and does nothing.
  </p>
  <p>Next, create a class called Square. All squares are Rectangles, so Square should <b>extend</b> Rectangle.
    <br>Now, squares should have a width and height that are the same. So your next step is to create
    <br>a constructor for Square that takes in three floats as parameters, a, b, and c.
    <br>Set the x of the Square equal to a, y equal to b, and the w and h both equal to c.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally create a Rectangle with a width of 50 and height of 100 and then a Square with a width and height of 100.
    <br>Use the constructors to do this! Don't just create them and then use the dot operator to set the width and height.
